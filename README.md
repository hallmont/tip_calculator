## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
  - Allow switching between 2 theme types within Settings page

## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1**: "What are your reactions to the iOS app development platform so far? How would you describe outlets and actions to another developer? Bonus: any idea how they are being implemented under the hood? (It might give you some ideas if you right-click on the Storyboard and click Open As->Source Code")

**Answer:**

Apple's XCode platform usually gets positive feedback from me ;)
Outlets and actions are ways for the ViewController to interact with its Views.  Outlets allows the ViewController to change the view (e.g. change a label, etc.).  Actions allow the ViewController to get events from the View (e.g. get a user's click events, etc.).  From the XML source code, it looks like both outlets and actions are defined within the "connections" tag.

**Question 2**: "Swift uses [Automatic Reference Counting](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH20-ID49) (ARC), which is not a garbage collector, to manage memory. Can you explain how you can get a strong reference cycle for closures? (There's a section explaining this concept in the link, how would you summarize as simply as possible?)"

**Answer:**

A strong reference cycle can occur if the closure has a strong reference to the class which contains the closure.  This typically occurs if the closure "captures" self and maintains a strong reference to the container class. There are other examples, but this is the most common scenario.
